# CMD in Abyss — Batch Script Game

**CMD in Abyss** is a text-based adventure game inspired by *Made in Abyss*, entirely developed using **Windows Batch (.bat)** scripting.

This project was created as a **class assignment** for the subject **Operating Systems** within the **Intermediate Vocational Training (FP Medio) in Microcomputer Systems and Networks**.

The game allows players to descend and ascend through different layers of the Abyss while following a short narrative. It includes both **ASCII** and **ANSI** versions, with the ANSI version providing enhanced visual quality.

> **Note:** All in-game dialogues and narrative content are written in **Spanish**.
